# ShopMart

A simple shopping cart application that retrieves products from the Fakestore API with a working cart system.

## Features

- Cart management (add, edit, delete)
  - Also added user validation by automatically setting the cart amount to 0 or 9999 depending on what the user types 
- Local storage (once the page is refreshed, the cart and cart quantity stays the same)
- Single Page Application via `react-router`

## Tools Used

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML + CSS**
- **React + Vite**
- **`react-router`**
- **Fakestore API**

## Why I Built This

For getting familar with `react-router`! Getting familar with how Single Page Applications (SPAs) work gave me valuable insights on how React can handle (or not handle) it.

## Potential Improvements

- Under the `Cart` page, improve the Quantity cell.
- **Add a working checkout system**, right now the user can only make edits to the cart without actually taking them anywhere
- Make a better homepage! It's so barebones!
